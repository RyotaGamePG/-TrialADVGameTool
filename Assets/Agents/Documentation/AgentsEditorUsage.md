# Agents Editor Usage

## Overview
- Open `Agents/Dashboard` from the Unity menu to generate required assets (`AgentsRuntimeConfig`, `StoryGraph`, `EvidenceLibrary`).
- Use the dashboard to jump into specialized editors for story graphs and evidence authoring.
- Place `AgentsRuntimeInstaller` in your bootstrap scene and assign the generated runtime config alongside scene-level `StoryRunner` and `TrialController` components.

## Authoring Flow
- Story Graph Editor: manage nodes, dialogue lines, and branching transitions guarded by flags or evidence.
- Evidence Library Editor: define collectible evidence along with presentation metadata.
- Timeline & Audio clips can be attached per line to synchronize voice and cinematic playback.

## Runtime Integration
- `AgentsRuntimeInstaller` builds the event bus, evidence service, and initializes attached controllers.
- `StoryRunner` publishes `StoryNodeStarted`, `StoryLineAdvanced`, and `StoryNodeCompleted` events for UI layers.
- `TrialController` routes `ReactionType` inputs and ensures evidence ownership before branching.
- `PortraitController` listens for story events and plays matching animator states named after speaker IDs.

## Demo Content
- `Agents/Scenes/AgentsDemo.unity`: click the main dialog area to advance the scripted trial flow. Use the `Show Evidence` button to open a placeholder viewer listing collected items (`Agent Badge` unlocks mid-demo) and text-based image stand-ins.
- The demo UI renders all portrait/audio slots as text debug overlays so the behaviour remains test-friendly without art assets.
- `Agents/Scenes/AgentsSaveSlots.unity`: displays three mock save slots with button-only navigation; selecting a slot populates text placeholders for thumbnails and timestamps.

## Testing
- Automated tests reside under `Assets/Tests/Agents` and validate branching logic along with evidence discovery workflows.
- Enable `Unity Test Runner` in Editor mode to execute the suite; tests rely on reflection helpers to configure serialized data objects without allocations at runtime.
